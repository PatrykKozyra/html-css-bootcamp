  <h1>CSS Reset</h1>
  <p>By default, browsers add styling to elements on a web page. We can see this with the heading tags. To complicate issues even further, different browsers style different elements in different ways. A “css reset” allows us to create a uniform starting point from which we can then style our pages. You can think of a “css reset” “zero’ing out” all default browser styling. There are different css resets that you can use. The best practice is to create your own reset. Understand ALL of your code. Have nothing in your code which is extraneous.
